# P3 Proposal Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard for tracking P3 (Proposal) meetings and their resulting deals performance. This application syncs data from HubSpot to Supabase and provides detailed analytics for sales teams.

  - Deals in play (< 150 days)
  - Overdue deals (150+ days)
  - Team averages and percentages

## Data Flow

The application follows this data relationship:
1. **P3 Meetings**: Identified by `meeting_outcome="P3 - Proposal"` OR `call_and_meeting_type="P3 - Proposal"` AND `meeting_outcome="Completed"`
2. **Contacts**: Retrieved from meeting contacts array (`Contacts_fk_Contacts`)
3. **Companies**: Associated with contacts via `company_uuid`
4. **Deals**: Filtered by `deal_type="Monthly Service"` OR `deal_type="Recurring Special Service"`

## Business Rules

- **Deal Status**: 
  - Won: `deal_status="Closed Won"`
